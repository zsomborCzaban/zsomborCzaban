# About me


I’m an Hungarian exchange student living in Finland. I love the Finnish culture, and the mentality of the Finnish people. I’m planning to move here, or at least do my masters at a Finnish university.

I’m always eager to learn. I‘m really passionate about the field of AI, and I love algorithms.
I try to broaden my horizons as much as I can, so I can have a solid foundation to start my career off from.
